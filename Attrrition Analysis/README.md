# This is the gui for the attrition analysis project done for Software Engineering (UE20CS303)

#### I have not done logist.py or 2.csv. Credit of that is to Allu Vineela Sravanthi, Aksshaya Ravikumar and Linson Andrew.

### To run it first:
* Make a table called login (id varchar, password varchar) in your database. MySQL is the database used.
* Change db_name in login to the database name which has the login table.
* Create or make a dataset like the one specified in pages/format.xlsx or use the deafult one provided.
* Now to run it type the command "streamlit run Home.py"

#### If any package is not install do it with pip or conda or google it. Sometimes streamlit will require an older version of a certain packages.
##### 1-5.jpg are the images choosen for the employees. logist.py is the model and 2.csv is the output of another. Currently the css does not work as streamlit changes ids on every run so a "dynamic" version of the css is required.
